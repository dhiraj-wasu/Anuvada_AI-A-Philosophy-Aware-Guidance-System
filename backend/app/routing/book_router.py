- Prayer vs meditation

Happiness / Peace

- What is lasting happiness?
- Why world pleasures don’t satisfy?

- How to live as Baba wants?
- What obstacles stop progress?

Following Meher Baba
- How to follow Baba truly?

- obedience, honesty, remembrance

Morality / Right conduct

Mind & Desires

General spiritual clarity

--------------------------
Life Eternal is NOT primary when
--------------------------
If the user asks heavy metaphysics like:
- cosmic creation structure
- evolution of consciousness through forms
- detailed reincarnation mechanism
- seven planes of consciousness in depth
-> use God Speaks as primary.

If user asks deep “life conduct + structured essays”
-> use Discourses as primary, and Life Eternal as supporting direct quotes.
